# 🌧️ Rain Detection System using Arduino & SIM800L

This project is a smart rain detection system built with Arduino and the SIM800L GSM module. It can automatically detect rain, send SMS alerts, make phone calls.

## 📌 Features

- Detects rain using rainwater sensor
- Sends **SMS alerts** on detection
- Makes **automated phone calls** to predefined numbers
- Triggers an **alarm system** for immediate response
- Optimized for **smart irrigation** and **weather warning systems**

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Arduino UNO
- Rain Sensor Module
- SIM800L GSM/GPRS Module
- Buzzer & LEDs
- C/C++ (Arduino IDE)

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The rain sensor detects water droplets.
2. On detection:
   - A buzzer alarm is triggered.
   - An SMS is sent via the SIM800L module.
   - An automatic call is made.
3. System resets after a delay or manual reset.
